# Yoga-posture-detection-and-correction-
We proposed a simple approach to solving the posture detection problem and we drew comparisons with multiple other complex, robust models. We also compared the models based on the kind of input it was receiving. We used CNN at the beginning and then we shifted to other methods and then we tried to compare and find the best among them. For Feeding the live video to the Model we used PostNet CNN models and stored them in a CSV for Logistic Regression. With the test accuracy of 86%. The CNN model was determined to be among CNN and CNN-parallel models.
